# Extreme Power Saving Solar Flower
Arduino code for a solar tracker

## Motivation




## Hardware Setup
From Amazon, I bought (KEYESTUDIO DIY Solar Tracking Electronic Kit for Arduino UNO IDE, Temperature and Humidity Sensor,BH1750 Light Sensor etc.Edu Programming Gift for Adults)[https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0B1NWBTS4?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1]
with an Arduino Uno and all necessary components. However, I wanted to improve the accuracy and duration of the system. 

To improve the accuracy, I put the photo sensors on the back side of the photovoltaic cell, to get the sensors to move with the photovoltaic cell. The principle behind it, is that 
the whole system shall move in the direction of the light. If the left photo sensor gets more light that the right sensor, then move to the left.
